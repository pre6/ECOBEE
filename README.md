# How Much Does the Furnace Impact the Gas Bill?

In an attempt to understand the impact of indoor temperature on the gas bill, I analyzed data from my HVAC system and my gas bill. I took data from the ecobee thermostat from June 29 to December 18, 2022. I correlated this data with the gas bill from this period. Some questions I asked were:

1. What is the average cost on the furnace per day during heating season?
2. When will I save enough money with the smart thermostat to offset the cost of the thermostat?
3. What adjustments do I have to make to my thermal comfort to save 10% on my gas bill?


## 1. Visualizing the Data:

The dataset used is from the ecobee thermostat which was recorded from June 29, 2022 to December 18, 2022. The thermostat recorded various metrics every 5 minutes. These are the first 5 row and 10 columns of the data.

## 2. How much does the furnace cost per day?

In the days the furnace runs how much does it cost? Roughly how much does the furnace cost when it turns one once?

This table represents the information in the gas bill.

|Start_Range| End_Range| Amount| Natural_Gas_Supply_Rate (cents/m^3)| M^3 of Gas used|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|2022-06-23	|2022-09-01	|109.33	|26.868	  |81|
|2022-09-02	|2022-10-05	|59.51	|27.9027	|57|
|2022-10-06	|2022-11-01	|105.43	|27.9027	|128|
|2022-11-02	|2022-12-02	|164.99	|27.9027	|224|


- The average spent on gas between these 4 ranges is $3.45/day. This was done by taking the total amount in a range and dividing by the number of days in range. Then we averaged the three value for the three ranges

$$ \frac{Total}{days}  $$

- To roughly find the amount the furnace cost per day, a baseline amount was estimated. The baseline is taken from the first range in which the furnace was not used once. This was on average $1.54 / day. 
- Next we subract this baseline from the average cost per day for all the other ranges. This is the average amount per day the furnace costs!

Example: With the range from Oct 06 to Nov 11

$$ 3.90 - 1.54 \\approx 2.36 $$

- We can then multiply the value by the number of days the furance was on. 

$$ 2.36* 23 \\approx 128.56 $$

- We can furthur divide by the number of time the furnace was on in the corresponding range to get a rough idea bout how much the furnace cost each time it turns on.

$$128.56/546 \\approx 0.099413$$


|Start_Range| End_Range| Amount|Times furnace On| Days furnace was on| Total days|amount per day|amount without the baseline|Amount Furnace costs every 5 mins|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|2022-06-23|	2022-09-01|	109.33|	   0|	 0|	71|	1.53985915492958|	-0.0|          NULL|

### Assumptions:
- The other appliance and things that use gas are not accounted for. For example it is possible that in the winter we use the water hearter more.
- The number of degrees outside affects the amount of times the furnace turns on. During these low temperature days it is possible that there is more gas used to heat the house.
- The thermostat only records data every five minutes. So when the furnace is recorded two times in a row it could possibily mean that the furnace was on during the whole duration or it could have stopped inbetween. In my analysis I consider one record of the furnace "turns on" as the number of times the thermostat recorded the furnace on. Therefore, the times the furnace turns on not in a 5 minute interval could possibily not be recored or the times where the furnace was recorded but only on for a short amount of time could be recorded as a comparable to a full 5 minute on. These are some limitations in my analysis.

## 3. When will I break even with my thermostat?

My thermostat cost $330. This will be compared to a standard government issued thermostat which holds 22 degrees celcius. The cycle the thermostat was on is:

|Start Time|End Time| Mode| Temperature|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|00:00:00|05:30:00|Sleep|19.5|
|05:30:00|22:30:00|Home|22|
|22:30:00|23:59:59|Home|22|

There is 17 hours in which the furance is turned on. Therefore the amount per day for gas actually pertains to 17 hours in which the furnace is on. Now we need to find out how much it would cost for the whole day:

$$ \frac{$3.54}{17hrs} = \frac{x}{24hrs} $$

$$ x \\approx 5.00$$

It is around $5.00 per day if the temperature was kept at 22 degrees celcius each day. The furance (from the ranges before) turns on at September 29th to Dec 18th. This is 81 days. If the furnace was set at 22 degrees the whole time, the amount would be:

$$ 5.00 * 81 = 405 $$
$$ 3.45 * 81 = 286.47 $$

$$405-286.47 = 118.26$$

We saved about 118.26

I esitmate in Canada we will have the furnace on for 8 months, which is 241 days

$$ 5.00 * 241 = 1205 $$
$$ 3.45 * 241 = 853.14 $$
$$ 1205 - 853.14 = 351.86$$

In 8 months you can break even with the thermostat.

### Assumptions:

We assume the the furnace would be running everyday.
Some days the furnace will run loger because it is colder
The cycle we set wasnt perfect. These were the average values


## 4. When will I have to adjust the temperature to save 10%?

Per day it is $3.54. If we saved 10% of that it would be:

$$ 3.54 * 0.1 = 0.354 $$

$$ 3.54 - 0.354 \\approx 3.19 $$

$$ \frac{3.54}{17} = \frac{3.19}{x} $$

$$ x \\approx 15 $$

If we have a 15 hr period where the furnace is on and the other 9 hours the furnace is not on we should save 10%

### Assumptions:

These assumptions will be simillar to the other assumptions. We are assuming the gas bill is just from the furnace. Also we assume that the furnace will turn on the same amount per day and use the same amount of gas despite the temperature outside.


## 5. Extra: Is there a correlation between the temperature outside and Furnace use?

There seems to be a correaltion between the number of times the furance runs in a day and the average temperature outside that day. When the temperature is 11 degrees or less the furnace turns on. As the temperature nears 0 or goes into the negatives, the number of times the furnace turns on increases.

The red line is the Number of times the furnace turns on a particular day

The blue line is the average temperature outside that particular day. 

The green line is the 11 degree line
