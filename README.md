## 1. Visualizing the Data:

- We will visulize the data we have currently.
- This is from the Ecobee Thermostat from January 1st to December 30th
- Here is the first 5 rows of the data

Date |	Time |	System Setting |    System Mode 	| Calendar Event |	Program Mode | Cool Set Temp (C) |	Heat Set Temp (C) |Current Temp (C) |Current Humidity (%RH)
|--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|	2022-01-01 |	00:00:00 |	heat |	heatOff |	NaN |	Sleep| 26.5 |	19.5 |	24.8 |	39.0 
|	2022-01-01 |	00:05:00 |	heat |	heatOff |	NaN |	Sleep| 26.5 |	19.5 |	24.7 |	39.0
|	2022-01-01 |	00:10:00 |	heat |	heatOff |	NaN |	Sleep| 26.5 |	19.5 |	24.6 |	39.0 
|	2022-01-01 |	00:15:00 |	heat |	heatOff |	NaN |	Sleep| 26.5 |	19.5 |	24.5 |	39.0 
|	2022-01-01 |	00:20:00 |	heat |	heatOff |	NaN |	Sleep| 26.5 |	19.5 |	24.5 |	39.0 

5 rows Ã— 10 columns



- This is a graph of the average temperature per day for the whole year:

- There are no breaks in the data from June 29th 2022 to December 18 2022 therefore we will only be focusing on this range of data


## 2. How much does the furnace cost per day

- In the days the furnace runs how much does it cost?
