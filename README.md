# How Much Does the Furnace Impact the Gas Bill?


## 1. Visualizing the Data:

The dataset used is from the house thermostat we got in June 29 2022. The data recorded various parameters ever 5 minutes till Dec 18th. These are the first 5 row of the data. 									


Date |	Time |	System Setting |    System Mode 	| Calendar Event |	Program Mode | Cool Set Temp (C) |	Heat Set Temp (C) |Current Temp (C) |Current Humidity (%RH)
|--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|	2022-06-29 |	18:05:00 |	off |	heatOff |	NaN |	Home| 25.5 |	20.5 |	25 |	59
|	2022-06-29 |	18:10:00 |	off |	heatOff |	NaN |	Home| 25.5 |	20.5 |	25 |	60
|	2022-06-29 |	18:15:00 |	off |	heatOff |	NaN |	Home| 25.5 |	20.5 |	25.1 |	59
|	2022-06-29 |	18:20:00 |	off |	heatOff |	NaN |	Home| 25.5 |	20.5 |	25.1 |	60
|	2022-06-29 |	18:25:00 |	off |	heatOff |	NaN |	Home| 25.5 |	20.5 |	25.1 |	60

- There are no breaks in the data from June 29th 2022 to December 18 2022 therefore we will only be focusing on this range of data


## 2. How much does the furnace cost per day

- In the days the furnace runs how much does it cost?


|Start_Range| End_Range| Amount| Natural_Gas_Supply_Rate (cents/m^3)| M^3 of Gas used|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|2022-06-23	|2022-09-01	|109.33	|26.868	  |81|
|2022-09-02	|2022-10-05	|59.51	|27.9027	|57|
|2022-10-06	|2022-11-01	|105.43	|27.9027	|128|
|2022-11-02	|2022-12-02	|164.99	|27.9027	|224|


- The average spent on gas between these 4 ranges is $3.45/day.
