## 1. Visualizing the Data:

- We will visulize the data we have currently.
- This is from the Ecobee Thermostat from January 1st to December 30th
- Here is the first 5 rows of the data

Date |	Time |	System Setting |    System Mode 	| Calendar Event |	Program Mode | Cool Set Temp (C) |	Heat Set Temp (C) |Current Temp (C) |Current Humidity
|--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
